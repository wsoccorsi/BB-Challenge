# 5 Full-Stack Challenges Completed

1. Ad
2. User relationship
3. Edit/Delete relationship
4. Multiple images upload
5. Pagination

All changes are fully tested in RSpec

Please note, mimemagic dependecy was an issue in this implementation so I had to change to a newer gem. I did not complete any front end challenges either, just added some flexbox to make it more readable.
